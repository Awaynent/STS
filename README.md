A simple project done by us 1st year CS students of CSVU-IMUS CAMPUS Philippines.
It uses python, javascript, html and css to function.
Run the python first to setup a local server for the html, it will show a localhost link in the terminal.
Click the link to get redirected to the html or website, javascript and css will run automatically.
A simple input field will showup after the html loads, enter a name to check if its in the system.
A result will appear if a name has been submitted.
Note: All names in the system are from the developers group, just to test the functionality of the system.
